== Description ==

**Academy Certificate Plugin‚ÄîDiscontinuation Notice**

We are excited to announce that the Academy Certificate plugin is now included as a built-in add-on in Academy LMS, making it easier than ever to manage and customize course certificates directly from the LMS interface. As part of this upgrade, we will soon discontinue this standalone plugin.

To continue using certificates with more flexibility and performance enhancements, we recommend deactivating the Academy Certificate plugin and accessing the built-in Certificate Add-on under the Add-ons section in Academy LMS.

**Why Switch to the Built-In Certificate Add-on?**

The built-in add-on provides powerful features that simplify the process of generating and customizing certificates, including:

* Certificate Verification ID: Easily verify certificates for authenticity.
* Individual Course Certificates: Assign certificates to specific courses with a few clicks.
* Premade Templates: Access a wide range of professionally designed certificate templates that you can customize without any coding.
* Drag-and-Drop Builder: Customize your certificates using an intuitive drag-and-drop builder, making it easy to personalize details like student names, course titles, dates, and more.

Full Integration with Academy LMS: No need for a separate plugin; certificates are now seamlessly integrated into the LMS for better performance and smoother operation.
